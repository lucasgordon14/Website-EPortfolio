    <h2 style="color:blue;"> About Me </h2>
    <p>In 2016 I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a Bachelors of Science degree in computer scicence with a concentration in AI Robotics and Game Design, as well as a minor in Japanese.  Shortly after graduating I worked for Amazon and evenutally worked my way up to working for Epic Games shortly after as a Software Tester 1 in the Quality Assurance department.  I worked at Epic Games for 4 months;  During these four months I learned how to prioritze tasks, utilize JIRA to record and close out bug reports based on bugs found within a private development server of the game Fortnite.  I worked alongside the performance team to help capture and record data about how the in game servers would react when pushed to it's maximum capacity of players during optional overtime.  Among this, I also utilized Testrail to log and record a checklist of new features that were under review for extensive testing.  My main tasks during this period were to test and debug "real money transactions" that the user engages in within the game as well as overall store functionality and core gameplay loops.</p>
